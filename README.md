# IoT-Based-Intelligent-Room-Temperature-Monitoring-and-Control-System-using-Firebase
This project aims to address the inefficiencies of manual room temperature management by creating an intelligent automation system capable of maintaining environmental comfort in real time. The development process involved integrating a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity detection, an ESP32 microcontroller as the processing unit, and Firebase Realtime Database for cloud-based data synchronization. 

The output of this project is a functional system that allows users to monitor room conditions and control DC fans automatically or remotely via an MIT App Inventor dashboard. This system is highly applicable for smart home implementations, server room temperature optimization, and maintaining climate stability in greenhouses to enhance energy efficiency and user comfort.
