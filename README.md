# IoT-Based-Intelligent-Room-Temperature-Monitoring-and-Control-System-using-Firebase
This project aims to address the inefficiencies of manual room temperature management by creating an intelligent automation system capable of maintaining environmental comfort in real time. The development process involved integrating a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity detection, an ESP32 microcontroller as the processing unit, and Firebase Realtime Database for cloud-based data synchronization.
